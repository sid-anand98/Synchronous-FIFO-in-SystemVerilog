# Synchronous-FIFO-in-SystemVerilog
Synchronous BUFFER/FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT in SystemVerilog

The data values were written sequentially into the memory array and read sequentially out of the memory array using the same clock signal. The test bench environment was built to verify the design. A SystemVerilog Verification testbench was created by developing the following components: packet, generator, driver, input monitor, design file (DUT), output monitor, and scoreboard.
